##An AI Chatbot with Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a software application that uses artificial intelligence and language understanding techniques to simulate human-like conversations. It can interpret user queries, understand context, and provide meaningful responses — either text or voice.

Core Components
Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Breaks down user input into understandable units.

Tasks include:

Tokenization (splitting sentences into words)

Part-of-Speech tagging (identifying nouns, verbs, etc.)

Named Entity Recognition (NER) (detecting names, dates, places)

Intent Recognition (understanding what the user wants)

Sentiment Analysis (detecting emotions)

Dialogue Management

Decides how the chatbot should respond based on:

User intent

Conversation history

Business logic or knowledge base

Response Generation

Creates a reply:

Rule-based (predefined templates)

AI-based (using ML/DL models for dynamic responses)

Learning Ability

Uses machine learning to improve accuracy from feedback and interactions.


Technologies Used
Python Libraries:

NLTK, spaCy → NLP processing

scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch → ML/DL models

Frameworks:

Rasa, Dialogflow, Microsoft Bot Framework

APIs:

OpenAI GPT models, Hugging Face transformers
